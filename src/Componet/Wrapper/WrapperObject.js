    question: "Describe the principles of supply and demand in economics.",
    answer: "Supply and demand are fundamental economic principles that determine the price and quantity of goods in a market. The law of demand states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. The law of supply states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa.",
